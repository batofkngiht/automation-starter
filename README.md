# automation-starter
I have built the basic scripts to automation and accessibilty over files 
Prolonging for continuous practise over the field of cyber with the help of python automation as a beginner

1.I started with my first file that is file organiser which was a very useful automation total but had to mnaually set the the distriution set.
2.honeyportscan is for the defenders it is useful until the the open ports which should have been facked ends up replying earlier then the defensive hineypot trick against the attacker hence a basic demonstration for how defense logically works"educational purpose".
3.portscan is the basic set tht is use to attack and send packets to server through tcp find SYN/ACK reponse and checking over the DNS for getting the target over dns server since google is most prominent thing on every device to get access on dns we would take tht to get over the dns scan and gives an example of attackers way of detecting loop hole.
